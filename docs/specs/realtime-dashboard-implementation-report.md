# Implementation Report: Real-time Dashboard Module
## Date: 2025-09-17
## PRD: realtime-dashboard.prd.md

## Implementation Status
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 Complete, Phase 2 Ready  
**Overall Progress**: 25%

## Phases Completed
- [x] Phase 1: Core Framework and Architecture
  - Tasks: IDashboardModule implementation, base panel system, data integration, Rich rendering
  - Commits: 7a1afed, 8319fd3, 212d5d8, 59e55ec, 1ef8686
  - **Deliverables Completed**:
    - Working dashboard with 3 basic panels (cost, tokens, burn rate) + trend chart
    - Manual refresh capability via CLI restart
    - Configuration persistence through export-config command
    - Mock data fallback for testing without bunx ccusage
    - 6 panel types implemented (metric, chart, list, heatmap, gauge, status)
    - Monokai theme support
    
- [ ] Phase 2: Live Updates and Auto-refresh
  - Tasks: Auto-refresh mechanism, enhanced chart panels, keyboard navigation
  - Commits: (pending)
  
- [ ] Phase 3: Themes and Customization
  - Tasks: Dracula/Nord themes, compact mode, layout customization
  - Commits: (pending)
  
- [ ] Phase 4: Advanced Features and Polish
  - Tasks: Performance optimization, animations, help system
  - Commits: (pending)

## Testing Summary
- Tests written: 0 (TDD approach deferred for Phase 1 rapid prototyping)
- Tests passing: N/A
- Manual verification: Dashboard launches successfully with mock data

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into dashboard, panel_renderer, data_source, and theme_manager
2. **Mock Data Support**: Implemented fallback to enable testing without bunx installation
3. **Rich Library Integration**: Leveraged Rich's Live display for flicker-free updates
4. **Interface Compliance**: Fully implemented IDashboardModule interface from PRD

### Key Features Implemented
- Live mode with configurable refresh rate (default 5s)
- 6 panel types with specialized rendering
- Data caching for trend calculation
- Graceful error handling with fallback to cached/mock data
- Theme system foundation with monokai support
- CLI with dashboard, stats, and export-config commands

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge 1**: bunx ccusage availability
  - **Solution**: Implemented mock data generator for Phase 1 testing
  
- **Challenge 2**: Panel layout management
  - **Solution**: Simplified to left/right split for Phase 1, complex grid deferred to Phase 3

## Critical Security Notes
- Authentication/Authorization changes: None implemented
- Data validation changes: JSON parsing with error handling
- Input sanitization: Subprocess output validated through json.loads()

## Next Steps for Phase 2
1. Implement keyboard event handling (q to quit, r to refresh, ? for help)
2. Enhance auto-refresh to update individual panels asynchronously  
3. Add sparkline history for all metric panels
4. Implement model distribution pie chart
5. Add context window utilization gauge
6. Create tests for core functionality
