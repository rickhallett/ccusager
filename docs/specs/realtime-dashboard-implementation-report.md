# Implementation Report: Real-time Dashboard Module
## Date: 2025-09-17
## PRD: realtime-dashboard.prd.md

## Implementation Status
**Current Phase**: Phase 2 Complete, Phase 3 Ready  
**Overall Progress**: 50%

## Phases Completed
- [x] Phase 1: Core Framework and Architecture
  - Tasks: IDashboardModule implementation, base panel system, data integration, Rich rendering
  - Commits: 7a1afed, 8319fd3, 212d5d8, 59e55ec, 1ef8686, 83e4709
  - **Deliverables Completed**:
    - Working dashboard with 3 basic panels (cost, tokens, burn rate) + trend chart
    - Manual refresh capability via CLI restart
    - Configuration persistence through export-config command
    - Mock data fallback for testing without bunx ccusage
    - 6 panel types implemented (metric, chart, list, heatmap, gauge, status)
    - Monokai theme support
    
- [x] Phase 2: Live Updates and Auto-refresh
  - Tasks: Auto-refresh mechanism, enhanced panels, keyboard navigation
  - Commits: (to be added after commit)
  - **Deliverables Completed**:
    - Full keyboard navigation with help system
    - Enhanced auto-refresh with pause/resume capability
    - Sparkline history for all metric panels
    - Model distribution panel with bar chart visualization
    - Context window utilization gauge
    - Efficiency score metric
    - Dynamic refresh rate adjustment
    - Theme cycling (preparation for Phase 3)
    - Status messages and notifications
    - Configuration export to JSON
  
- [ ] Phase 3: Themes and Customization
  - Tasks: Dracula/Nord themes, compact mode, layout customization
  - Commits: (pending)
  
- [ ] Phase 4: Advanced Features and Polish
  - Tasks: Performance optimization, animations, help system
  - Commits: (pending)

## Testing Summary
- Tests written: 27 test cases across 5 test classes
- Tests passing: All tests pass with mock data
- Manual verification: Dashboard runs with full keyboard interaction

## Implementation Details

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Modular Design**: Separated concerns into dashboard, panel_renderer, data_source, and theme_manager
2. **Mock Data Support**: Implemented fallback to enable testing without bunx installation
3. **Rich Library Integration**: Leveraged Rich's Live display for flicker-free updates
4. **Interface Compliance**: Fully implemented IDashboardModule interface from PRD

### Key Features Implemented
- Live mode with configurable refresh rate (default 5s)
- 6 panel types with specialized rendering
- Data caching for trend calculation
- Graceful error handling with fallback to cached/mock data
- Theme system foundation with monokai support
- CLI with dashboard, stats, and export-config commands

## Challenges & Solutions
- **Challenge 1**: bunx ccusage availability
  - **Solution**: Implemented mock data generator for Phase 1 testing
  
- **Challenge 2**: Panel layout management
  - **Solution**: Simplified to left/right split for Phase 1, complex grid deferred to Phase 3
  
- **Challenge 3**: Non-blocking keyboard input
  - **Solution**: Implemented threaded keyboard handler with raw terminal mode
  
- **Challenge 4**: Smooth auto-refresh without flicker
  - **Solution**: Leveraged Rich's Live display with 2fps update rate

## Critical Security Notes
- Authentication/Authorization changes: None implemented
- Data validation changes: JSON parsing with error handling
- Input sanitization: Subprocess output validated through json.loads()

## Next Steps for Phase 3
1. Implement dracula and nord themes with full color schemes
2. Add compact mode for smaller terminals (80x24)  
3. Enable panel repositioning and drag-and-drop
4. Implement panel resizing with terminal constraints
5. Add terminal resize event handling
6. Create customizable layout templates
